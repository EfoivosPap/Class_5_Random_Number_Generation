# Class_5_Random_Number_Generation
Welcome to an 1 hour exercises for PRNG algorithms

## Overview
In this class we are going to see how different kindes of algorithms produse a word key and what algorithms are most used for cryptography. We will se the following:

1. **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)**(#LCG)
2. **Mersenne Twister**
3. **Blum-Blum Shub(BBS)**
4. **Blum-Micali(BM)**

Each script is accompanied by tasks and exercieses to better understand the algorithms.
